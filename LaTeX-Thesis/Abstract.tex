	This research proposes the utilisation of four different techniques of animation storage (Axis Angle, Quaternions, Rotation Matrices and Euler Angles), in order to determine via the training of autoencoders, the advantages and disadvantages of each method for reconstructing and denoising parsed data, through a convolutional neural network.

	Our results establish that the most accurate method for this purpose is Quaternions, followed up by Euler Angles and with equivalent results using Rotation Matrices and Axis Angles. The denoising of sequences produces the best results quantitatively and qualitatively with the use of Quaternions representations over 25\% of added noise.
