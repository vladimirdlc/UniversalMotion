	% Requiment from the University: (1) must be page ''iii''; (2) text not exceeding 250 words.
	This research proposes the utilisation of four different techiniques for animation storage:
	axis-angle, euler angles, rotation matrices and quaternions, in order to determine via the use
	of autoencoders, the advantage and disadvantage of each of this techiniques for preserving and producing
	reconstructed data parsed throught a convolutional neural network.
		The experiment achieves a record-breaking accuracy, higher than the result of 98.04% in the 
	NN competition. The recall of the experiment is nn%, exceeding the best result nn.nn%.
