\chapter{Literature Review} \label{chap:literature}

In this chapter it will be referenced previous literature and related research to this thesis.
It's worth noticing that neural networks have been developed as a medium of defining
problem solving in a defined fashion similar to the structure of the human brain.

Neural networks have emerged as a ubiquitous model in machine learning, due their flexibility to adapt to very different types of problems, and handling a numerous amount of variables.
From prediction models to pattern recognition, image processing, or generative models, NN and DL are techniques that are defined to learn from data, allowing them to do data-driven decisions.
Learning from experience, machines therefore can solve problems without the definition
of a predefined model, but in doing so, at least with a classical implementation, such as
CNN, the definition of the model is then encoded within the a set of neurons, called hidden layer, makes it more difficult to easily interpret or change the model without re-training the neural network with other data that could adapt the output of the model.

For the setup of the neural networks and tools to be used in the implementation
the following components were used:

\subsection{Keras}  \label{subSec:Keras}

\citet{Keras:2018} is a framework for easy and fast protyping of neural networks 
that can run in CPU or GPU's, excelent for deep learning. It runs using
Python and works as an abstraction layer for another backend suchs as
Tensorflow and Theano. 

Keras contains numerous functions for building blocks such as layers, 
objective functions, activation functions, optimizers, and a set of tools to facilitate 
the work with image and text.

\subsection{Tensorflow}  \label{subSec:Tensorflow}

As defined in their github repository \citep{Tensorflow:2018} "TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs.
The graph nodes represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays 
(tensors) that flow between them. This flexible architecture enables you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, 
server, or mobile device without rewriting code. TensorFlow also includes TensorBoard, a data visualization toolkit."

\subsection{Autoencoders}  \label{subSec:Autoecoders}

One of the several applications of neural networks is the definition of an architecture defined as Autoencoders. Autoencoders are structures that are compromise of at least an enconding layer, a number of hidden layers and a decoder, where the hidden space is decoded as output.

This type of algorithms have several applications from denoising, to reconstruction, and  definition of manifolds depending of the input of the raw data provided.
