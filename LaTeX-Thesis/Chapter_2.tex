It's worth noticing that neural networks have been developed as a medium of defining
problem solving in a defined fashion similar to the structure of the human brain.

Neural networks have emerged as a ubiquitous model in machine learning, due their flexibility 
to adapt to very different types of problems, and handling a numerous amount of variables.
From prediction models to pattern recognition, to image processing, or generative models, NN and DL are
techniques are defined to learn from data, allowing them to do data-driven decisions [101]
Learning from experience, machines therefore can solve problems without the definition
of a predefined model, but in doing so, at least with a classical implementation, such as
CNN, the definition of the model is then encoded within the a set of neurons, called hidden layer,
making it more difficult to easily interpret or change the model without re-training the 
neural network with other data that could adapt the output of the model.
